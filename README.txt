Introduction
============

This package provides a new control panel for the Plone content management 
system.  The purpose of this control panel is to allow easy replacement of the
site logo.  

After installing the package, the user will find a new control panel listed
under the products category in Plone's Site Setup area. Clicking on the name
of the panel will open a view providing a preview of the current site logo and
a file upload field to replace that logo. If the user chooses to upload a new
site logo, that new logo will replace the existing one, and the logo will
change for the site.
